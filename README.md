Visualizing Automorphisms of Graph Algebras
============================================

This repository contains software for exhaustive computation and analysis of
permutative automorphisms of graph C*-algebras.

A paper detailing this work is available from here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4274. 

**NB: 24/8/2016: Currently, only a simple bare-bones version of the
software is made available.  I am adding the full
software package in steps, as the source code is being
cleaned up.**

If you find this software useful, please let us know; and if you use
this software in academic work, please cite the associated paper:
